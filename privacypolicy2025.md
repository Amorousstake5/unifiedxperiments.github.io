# Privacy Policy for Math Challenge! Android App

**Effective Date: August 15, 2025**

Thank you for using Math Challenge! (the "App"), an Android application that utilizes the Android System WebView to display and interact with a local HTML page stored on your device. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. Since the App operates entirely locally and does not connect to the internet or any external servers, our data practices are minimal.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about you. All functionality is handled locally on your device using the built-in Android System WebView component.

- **No Personal Data Collection**: We do not gather any identifiable information such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers, or usage patterns.
- **Local HTML Page**: The App loads a static HTML page stored locally on your device. Any interactions occur solely within the WebView and do not involve data transmission to us or third parties.
- **No Analytics or Tracking**: The App does not include any analytics tools, cookies, or tracking technologies.

If the local HTML page includes scripts or features that could potentially access device resources (e.g., via JavaScript), such access is limited to what is permitted by Android's WebView permissions and does not involve sending data off-device.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any information, there is no usage of personal data by us. All processing happens locally on your device for the purpose of rendering the HTML content.

## 3. Sharing Your Information

We do not share any information with third parties because no information is collected or stored by the App.

## 4. Data Security

While the App does not handle personal data, we encourage you to keep your device secure. The local HTML page and any associated files are stored on your device, so standard Android security measures apply. We recommend using device passwords, keeping your Android OS updated, and avoiding sideloading untrusted apps.

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, there are no specific concerns regarding children's privacy. However, we advise parental supervision for any app usage by minors.

## 6. Your Rights

As no personal data is collected, rights such as access, deletion, or portability under laws like GDPR or CCPA do not apply. If you have concerns about the local files, you can uninstall the App to remove them from your device.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on our website (if applicable). Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
